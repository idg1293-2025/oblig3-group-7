# About our project

## Project overview/ purpose
The purpose of our project is to raise awareness around **Goal 14: Life Below Water**. We combine the facts about plastic pollution and its effects on marine life with a compelling story about our everyday choices and the impacts they may have on our environment. 

## Brainstorming
We were discussing different SDG Goals and we were coming up with storytelling ideas based on these goals. In this phase we were interested in a couple ideas - one about **Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation** where you follow a drop of water on a journey from a polluted river to a thirsty child, and another one about **Goal 14** that was slightly different from the one we ended up choosing, depicting an underwater world full of plastic. 

## Storyboard
The storyboard was made using hand-drawings and handwritten text on a sheet of paper that had a template printed on it. Our storyboard depicts all four scenes of our story. We follow the two main characters (boy and girl) who are spending some time of their day on the beach. They stumble upon a bottle, but they don't care. After being informed about the serious consequences that plastic pollution has on sea creatures, they change their mindset and decide to do good by tidying up the beach.
